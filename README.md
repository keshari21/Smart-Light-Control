# DESCRIPTION
This project demonstrates a simple Smart Light Control System using an Arduino Uno and an LED. The LED can be turned ON or OFF via serial commands sent from the computer.

**Project Overview**
This project allows users to control an LED using serial communication. The Arduino listens for commands (ON or OFF) from the Serial Monitor and toggles the LED accordingly.

**Features**
Control the LED via serial commands.    
Simple and effective smart light control system.
Can be extended to control real-world appliances.

**Components Required**
Arduino Uno,
LED,
Resistor (220Ω),
USB Cable,
Jumper Wires.

**Circuit Diagram**
The attached circuit consists of:
LED connected to digital pin 9,
A 220Ω resistor in series with the LED to prevent excessive current,
GND connection to complete the circuit.

**How to Use**
Upload the code to the Arduino board.
Open the Serial Monitor (Baud Rate: 9600).
Type "ON" and press Enter to turn the LED ON.
Type "OFF" and press Enter to turn the LED OFF.

**Output**
